<p>How do you ensure your classroom assessments are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of all your students? 
<strong>A new study in India has explored how teachers are assessing students with disability.</strong>
<em>In this article, Anannya Chakraborty shares findings from the study, and what they mean for teachers and school leaders.
Research shows that formative assessments have a significant role in supporting the learning progress of all students.
Based on assessment feedback, teachers can adjust instructions to address the learning area in which an individual student is not be performing well<sup> (Black & Wiliam, 1998).</sup> 
<sub>In the context of disability inclusion, teachers can adapt teaching practices and curriculum based on feedback</sub> from formative assessments<ins> (UNESCO, 2019).</ins>  
In India, the National Education Policy (NEP) emphasises the importance of formative assessments to improve quality and equity in school education </em>

<ins>Teachers have a central role in formative assessments, right from designing the tests to offering accommodations and an appropriate test environment.</ins>
In our study, we looked at how teachers assess students with disability through formative assessments.
<b>The findings have been published in the Australasian Journal of Special and Inclusive Education<b> <del>(Chakraborty et al., 2024)</del>
